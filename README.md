# University Project: Air Quality Monitoring App
This project is part of our university coursework. We are developing a user interface using the Flutter framework to monitor and provide feedback on air quality data, including oxygen levels, CO2, and ozone values. The app also features data visualization to make the information more accessible and understandable. 
We are working collaboratively as a team and will continuously update this repository as we add new code and features.
